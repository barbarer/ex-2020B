Pretest Problem 2
-------------------

Try to solve the following fix code problem.  You have five minutes to try to
solve it.  It is okay if you can't solve it, you will earn credit for trying to
solve it.

.. timed:: pre-exa-2
   :timelimit: 300

   .. activecode:: adjacentTwos_fix_timed
      :autograde: unittest
      :nocodelens:

      Fix the function ``adjacentTwos`` below to return True if there are at least two adjacent 2's in list ``nums``, otherwise return False.  For example, return ``True`` for ``adjacentTwos([1, 2, 2])`` since there are two adjacent items equal to 2 (at index 1 and 2) and ``False`` for ``adjacentTwos([2, 1, 2])`` since the 2's are not adjacent.

      def adjacentTwos(nums):
          i = 1
          while i < nums:
              if nums[i] = 2 and nums[i - 2] == 2:
                 return true
              i += 1
              return False

      print(adjacentTwos([1, 2, 2]))
      print(adjacentTwos([2, 1, 2]))
